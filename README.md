# Python Logging and Debugging

This repository serves as a basic guide to understanding and utilizing logging and debugging techniques in Python. 
It covers two essential topics: **logging** to capture the flow of operations and **debugging** using assertions. 
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository provides valuable insights into improving 
the quality and reliability of your Python code.
Logging and debugging are fundamental aspects of software development. Effective logging helps you capture important 
information about the execution of your program, while debugging techniques allow you to identify and fix issues within 
your code. This repository aims to provide you with practical examples.


### This repository covers two main topics:

1. **Logging:** Learn how to use Python's built-in logging module to create informative logs that document the flow of
   your program, capture errors, and monitor its behavior.

3. **Debugging:** Explore basic debugging techniques using assertions to catch and handle logical errors in your code,
   ensuring its correctness.
